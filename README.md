# fAIble bud

fAIble bud is an Alexa Skill that allows you to create unique custom fable on demand for the little ones. You specify what moral or lesson be learnt and the skill will generate a unique fable for you, complete with a high quality 
realistic AI generated voice narration powered by the ElevenLabs technology

# Problem we are solving

- Parents are busy and don't have time to read to their kids
- Kids are spending too much time on screens
- Kids are not learning the right values and morals
- Audiobooks and books are generally not personalized and sometimes not available when a certain values and lessons need to be taught 

# Benefits

- Kids tend to learn better in a form of a story
- Eleven Labs Cloned voice technology (as showcased in 3 out of the 7 voices) can help the little ones connect better
to the reader
- Alexa speakers is everywhere, there are over 100 million Alexa enabled devices. All mobilephones can also use Alexa via
Alexa app. Alexa Auto allows you to use Alexa in your car. Alexa is also available on many other devices such as TVs, etc.

# Market Potential

You can use this at home or even on the move in the car, etc!

There are over 100 million Alexa enabled devices out there and many times more users per device.

# Testing

Currently the Alexa Skill is in development mode and is not yet published (approval process may take up to a week). To
test the skill, you need to be added as a alpha/beta tester. Please contact the author to be added as a beta tester.

For a limited time during the hackathon judging period, the team have shared a testing simulator interface available at 
https://creator.voiceflow.com/prototype/64c6bcd909d04078840fdc5e

Please note that full experience can only be tested on an Alexa device and the simulator mileage varies.

The team highly suggests watching the hackathon presentation video where a live alexa demo is shown.

# Architecture

The Alexa Skill is currently created by VoiceFlow a hosted no-code platform. The backend is a NodeJS server whose source code is in this repo that does the many heavy duty lifting.
whose primary function is to make calls to the ElevenLabs API to generate the audio narration.

# Alexa Backend Server

The Alexa front end skill (created in Voiceflow) utilizes this backend server to handle the following:

- Synthetizing of text to speech using the Eleven Labs API and returning back an AUDIO data URI
- Easy testing and experimenting with different settings to generate the best audio output
- Once the audio is generated by Eleven Labs, it is processed in real time to the format that can be played on Alexa devices and stored in an AWS S3 Bucket

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/goldzulu/faiblebud.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```
   cd faiblebud
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Replace `your_api_key_here` in the `.env.template` file with your Eleven Labs API key.

   ```
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   PORT=3000
   ```

5. Rename the `.env.template` file to `.env`.


## Running the Backend Server

Run the following command in the project directory:

```
npm start
```

The server will start listening on the specified port (default is 3000). You can now make a POST request to the `/synthesize` endpoint with the text and voice settings as input.

## API Endpoint

**POST** `/synthesize`

**Request Body:**

- text(required): The text to synthesize.
- voice (optional): The voice to use for synthesis. Default is '21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM'.
- voice_settings (optional): An object containing additional voice settings.
  - stability (default: 0)
  - similarity_boost (default: 0)

**Response:**

Returns an object containing the synthesized audio in a data URI format.

```json
{
  "audioDataURI": "data:audio/mpeg;base64,..."
}
```

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Hello, world!", "voice": "21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM", "voice_settings": {"stability": 0, "similarity_boost": 0}}' \
  http://localhost:3000/synthesize
```

## Example Response

```json
{
  "audioDataURI": "data:audio/mpeg;base64,//uQZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
}
```
